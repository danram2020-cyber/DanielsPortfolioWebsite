            Hey everyone, this is a laid back place of my website, this is where i will talk about my hobbies, music, art, etc. I maybe a bit 
            generic but thats all good :)
            The picture above was during my last few days of Summer Vacation(2021), I went to Red Rock Canyon just outside of Las Vegas and saw 
            the beauty of nature and how peaceful was there, and how hot it was(110 F), no seriously it was hot there. FYI, don't wear any pants or
            long sleeves there during the summer, I am saving your life!
        </p>

            For music, I like exploring new genres but the ones I defeintly listen to the most has to be rap of any kind and rock. You should
            see my Spotify playlist, its a bunch of genres all in one place, I listen to classical through rap and Lofi through Corridos/ballards.
            I even have some oldie type songs from the 40s/50s that I also have a heart for due to my grandparents. But again, I like all type of music
            just no new country, no no no, I do not want to hear about the love story of a rancher and his tractor. That was a joke by the way, I dont actually mean it.

        <p>
            My hobbies are pretty tamed and pretty normal for a comp sci major, other than coding for obviuous reasons, I'll take coding out 
            as one of my hobbies. Most of my hobbies are in video games, espically with rpgs(role playing games), other than Halo, which is a first person shooter due to having a special place in my heart
            as the first video game I played on console and as well with its rich lore it has manufactured over the years. So what else other than video games do I put my time in?
            Well for almost 2 years I have been investing in stocks and gathered enough info to help others go into investing, and my portforlio has seen many ups and downs, but thats that whole point of 
            stock investing, its all about luck and risk, and I do love taking risks and love how money flows.

                So far I am trying to get into more hobbies or side projects so I can expand my knowledge expand and see what I like and don't like. For example,
            I use to write my own little stories, but given with many factors and how heavy editing your work is, as well as changing stories entirely sometimes, I sorta left it.
            So far im trying to get into more cryto-currency due to how impactful it has influence many people into investing. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that I guess these are the hobbies at the moment where I am most happy and stuck for so long with, in the future I hope to get more hobbies that satisfy my person and realize what is 
            right for me.
